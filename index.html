                            </div>
                            <p>
                                The theme of our digital exploration project evolved from the general question of the representation of non-western worlds in the media to the question of the self-representation of Middle Eastern women in international media. All through this project, we specialized in the Middle East and North Africa(n) [MENA] region, spread out in between the Morrocan coast to east Pakistan. Historically speaking, with the rise of Islamic fundamentalism and the event of 9/11, the question of Middle Eastern women agency has been centralising the stage of international attention. We noticed the trend of Middle Eastern Women living in Westernised Societies (Europe/ US, etc) utilising social media as a tool to empower themselves as well as others and rewrite narratives surrounding them. For example, in western media, when middle eastern women are constantly portrayed as victims of oppression, it paints a very shallow narrative and deprives them of being seen as true humans.
                                New interactive media like Facebook and Instagram appears to be the breeding ground for social activism for these women, and break these stereotypes. 

                                On the other hand, both traditional media (through movies) and social media also seem to proliferate content that misrepresents these women. In traditional western media (movies), Middle Eastern women are typically portrayed as victims of oppression or are vilified. New interactive media adds an additional layer of challenge. Since, new media unlike traditional media such as Newspapers has no gatekeepers, and is interactive, any unchecked opinions have the capacity to be taken as the truth and spread using ‘Like’ and ‘Share’ algorithms in interactive new media such as Facebook and Instagram. Moreover, media has the power to draw attention to certain topics more so than others, therefore framing narratives entirely around the perspectives covered. This is dangerous especially in the light of the wave Islamophobia that we notice in Europe, [and particularly now in France following the murder of a high school teacher Samuel Paty]. As mentioned by Nobel Peace Laureate Tawakkol Karem, conflating notions of Terrorism with the religion Islam unjustly alienates and dehumanises Muslims around the world.

                                This brings us to our project’s problematique: In this socio-political context with the role of media cultivating narrow stereotypes of MENA women, how are these women using new media to challenge misrepresentations and empower themselves? (We will be exploring misrepresentation of media under the lens of ‘Colonialism and Orientalism’, ‘Sexism’ and notions of ‘Victimhood, followed by the process of empowerment. Our research is focused on MENA women living in westernised societies outside the MENA region (who still identify themselves as belonging to the region). </p>

                            <h6>Methodology </h6>
                            <p>There are two components: Our research includes a combination of background research and critical discourse analysis of the topic at hand, alongside first-hand data collection.<br> Critical discourse analysis was used to understand language and framing of media to unpack underlying agendas and ideological/cultural influences - for example in the usage and evolution of the word ‘Beurette’ as will be explored later.<br>

                                First-hand data collection: We interviewed 8 people living outside the MENA region in Europe, who identified themselves as part of the region.<br> They had grown up in the region/ had origins in those lands and were able to give detailed testimonials on our problematique, relating to the themes of identity issues, colonialism & orientalism, islamophobia, victimhood and empowerment.<br> We also interviewed a North African Historian and professor who specialises in the study of Arab Cinema to give an academic insight to our problematique.<br> Our topic runs deep and we acknowledge the challenges in picking up on nuances and details of personal experiences that explore MENA women, and therefore we decided to choose interviews as our primary methodology.<br> Our interviewees shared a unique bond between continents and cultures, and who therefore were familiar to the westernised conceptions of MENA region in general.<br> 

                                Our interviews and research were compiled and published in an Instagram page that we created, called ‘W.O.M.E.N.A’. 

                                Through our Instagram, we also collected data from a second group: This group belongs to the receiving end of the news and feeds that typically misrepresents MENA women.<br> We wanted to confirm the extent to which misconceptions of MENA women lies, and hear thoughts from our 145 Instagram followers (majority from SciencesPo, as well as others from countries such as Singapore, US, Canada, etc) 

                                We posted quizzes in our stories, and open-ended questions on controversial topics to spark debates and discussion on the topic of MENA women.<br> It was interesting to evaluate responses from a lot of international students who study about the Middle East and MENA region.<br> The responses we received will be discussed in details below. <br>

                                Why did we choose Instagram? Instagram is the most popular amongst 18-30 years olds, and is able to broadcast the lived experiences of MENA women in a bite-sized, aesthetically pleasing manner (therefore not only demands attention but is easily registrable). <br>It gets the message concretely and is also an interactive platform. <br>Not only is it the very platform through which MENA women break stereotypes through channels such as, @commun.exil, @zarafetgalleries, @borderthinking, etc, it also facilitates a two-way conversation which we believe is important to spread awareness and break people out of their moulds. <br>

                            <h2>Self-perception of MENA Women</h2>
                            <p>We started our background research on the topic of misrepresentation of MENA women and how it poses challenges to the ‘self-perception’ of MENA women living in Westernised societies.<br> In an academic paper published by the University of Arkansas Undergraduate Research,  the author explains how MENA women typically fall under extreme (Western stereotypes).<br> MENA women are portrayed under the notions of Victimhood (as being oppressed), under the notions of an ‘escapee’ as someone who breaks free from the shackles of oppression and removes the veil.<br> The author makes an excellent point that when these women are considered powerless to speak, and the West speaks “both on behalf and in place of them” it not only ironically denies the freedom of expression of these MENA women to speak for themselves, but also recycles oversimplified narratives of them and paints them in a light that is palatable for the West.<br> In this way, the media silences them, both literally by casting them aside, but metaphorically too by presenting them only for the purpose of representing her invisibility or silence.<br>”

                                As MENA women are working against these misrepresentations, there lies a conundrum that they face in westernised countries: An identity that juggles between having progressive notions such as gender equality (that are framed as being white-washed by some middle-easterners, therefore invalidating them) and maintaining their cultural identity such as for example wearing hijab (for which they face discrimination in western Europe/ US due to Islamophobia and/or principles of laïcité in France for instance.).<br> One of our interview questions tackled with this self-perception of MENA women coming from MENA region but are currently living in westernised foreign countries.<br> We wanted to figure out if there was an inherent identity struggle that manifested in the form of ‘code-switching’, and also through perceptions of other MENA women in our interviews. <br>

                      It is interesting to see the misconceptions of MENA region and women from our Instagram respondents of our quizzes who are mainly students of SciencesPo who study about the region - a key indicator of the impact of media misrepresentations and the extent to which it is internalised.<br> The media’s portrayal of Lebanon as a comparatively progressive nation with women as being ‘free’ has led to many of our respondents to overestimate the legal age for girl’s marriage (9 in Lebanon for some religion with the possible exceptions for even younger girls) and over-estimating the women in Parliament even though it is only 4.7 per cent.<br> The alternative can be said about countries such as Saudi Arabia where most of our respondents assumed that only 4.7% of women are represented in the Parliament although the actual figure is 19.9%. The way in which women Saudi women are represented in the media led our followers to under-estimate the role of women. <br>

Having said that, it is also heartening to see a discussion being facilitated followed by our posts on Campus chants (that is racist). We had respondents taking both sides, with the majority agreeing to the notion that these chants are unacceptable.<br> The idea of respecting other people’s religion and MENA women was also common in our responses.<br>




Following our interviews of people from the MENA region, as well as the Historian and Cinema Arab Professor, we identified that the misrepresentation of MENA women in the media lies in 3 main themes; namely: Sexism, Orientalism & Colonialism and perceptions of Victimhood. We combined the responses in our interviews and plucked out key quotes to form a coherent narrative under the various themes. <br>

                        The MENA region is representative of women from different walks of life. As mentioned by Othamane, the international media representation of women in   the MENA region is incredibly monolithic. “women who live in the cities are different from the ones living in more rural areas.”  There are also differences between regions. “Like women in Morocco are different from other countries in the region.” There is a tendency for the media to conflate the narratives, and give a very narrow description of women living in the MENA region. Yasmin also echoes this point with “women experiences vary depending on class and religiosity, urban vs rural lifestyles.” Mariam recalls her own experience to support this idea: “I’m more free to do whatever I want than most women of the population, and then I'm not pressured by people around me to dress a certain way. I have to say my situation doesn’t reflect the situation of most women in Egypt.”

                         While we should bear in mind that diversity of MENA women, sexism is one of the aspects that prevails in the experiences of MENA women and is highlighted in media as well. Mariam recalls watching “a man striking his wife on television.” Abuse against women doesn’t just stay in the media; there is a lot of “sexism, internalised misogyny” and noticeable “cases of sexual harassment.” Meriem says she “wasn’t as free as (she) wanted to be”. “for instance I couldn’t visit some neighbourhoods without my parents/ group of friends accompanying me… and I have some friends who had brothers: in some households, they would let the son do stuff that the daughters are aren’t allowed.”
 
Sexism is more than about fears of harassment and physical freedom. It is more undercurrent. For example, the way men and women are treated differently has an impact on how MENA women chose to express themselves as well.  Nesrine talks about how (She) "Always have a scarf or something in case someone said something about my head and I have to cover it quickly.” They also create expectations differently for men and women in society. Aliaa says that in Egypt, “a lot of working women are wives and mothers and they do not get credited for sufficiently”. Women in Egypt are expected to juggle between their traditional roles as “mothers and housewives” while working and the fact that “women are even allowed to work is being interpreted as being sufficiently progressive in the Egyptian society”. When the job market is hard, this adds a “layer of discrimination” for women in terms of job opportunities. The situation that prevails in Aliaa’s household is quite different compared to the society at large. Aliaa while acknowledging her privilege goes on to talk about how her family “pushes (her) for success - academic or otherwise”. It is interesting to see how the situation in Egypt where it is still making good progress in terms of gender equality has a different, rather opposite influence in Aliaa’s household to pursue success against society’s norms. Although this is a nuance that the media typically looks past over by still rooting narratives surrounding sexism to harassment issues or complete subjugation of women (i.e. not being able to work, confined to the roles of housewives, etc), the issue of sexism represented in media is not too far-fetched from the reality.

                         The colonial powers in the Middle East and North Africa perceived the people from the region, their culture and values in a negative light, oftentimes as ˜barbaric. In fact, the literature surrounding underdeveloped brain structures, and limited capacity to be civilised took centre stage during colonial periods. One can observe this sense of superiority still persisting in western popular media today when it comes to representation of MENA women - even if it's to a smaller extent, and is more undercurrent. 
<br>
Love knows no Boundaries?
<br>For instance, Yasmin observes how Maghrebi women in French films always end up being with a white man and ends up liberating herself from her familial background and culture, and is properly integrated into French society She continues with, I have never seen a french movie where there has been a genuine and good relationship between North African women and men, or woman of colour and man of colour .. and the women always ends up with a white man to be palatable to the French taste.
 
<br>It is interesting to explore how liberal values like ‘love knows no boundaries’ underpins these narratives at face value, implying that differences in background and culture are not an obstacle to a white man and an Arab woman falling in love. Although this same representation points to a very skewed idea of integration: that the integration and acceptance of Maghrebi women are predicated upon her interactions with Europeans, and a noticeable distancing from her cultural roots. 
<br> 
Do you know what Beurette means?
<br>It is a word created by the french to originally represent integration and Maghrebi women, and liberating herself from the old values that repressed her. Pushes the idea of what North African women should be. It is interesting to see the linguistic evolution of the word burette because it has evolved to become hyper-sexualised. We observe a skewed interpretation of the very notion of liberty. This fetishization of Muslim women has colonial and oriental roots as well, where they were exoticised by Europeans. If we see French colonial history we see this obsession with the Muslim women
<br> 
Hijab = Oppression?
<br>When Muslim women are encouraged against wearing hijab (with hijab being associated with oppression under westernised perceptions), the freedom of expression of Muslim women is ironically being clamped down.
 
<br>One can observe a strong condemnation over wearing of hijab in french society, that considers a contradiction of its secular principles. The North African Historian that we interviewed (who chooses to remain anonymous) recounts the Decathlon issue, where the french sportswear stopped selling hijab women runners following a public outcry. Yasmin adds on saying that In French media, there are politicians who condemn the wearing of hijab under the notions of women’ rights who also have a background of sexually harassing women. Ideals like women’s rights should be universal, it shouldn’t be picked and chosen when it fits one’s circumstances. And you see the Muslim community being scapegoated and used to push for skewed narratives and justify the clamping down the freedom of expression of MENA women using rather colonial narratives that cultural representations of Islam like wearing of hijab indicate oppression.

                         The victim stigma and the anticipated liberation by the west is still a predominant image of MENA women in popular media with 8/9 interviews mentioning perceptions of victimhood as the main stereotype - a gross oversimplification and misrepresentation. We also managed to confirm that this perception was internalised through media through our Instagram quizzes. Our cine Arab interview confronts this misrepresentation from a historical perspective. He explains, there is a gap between the end of the colonial cinema and the 80’s where women from the region are completely absent from the screens only to come back as minor roles:  individuals at the margins of society and at the mercy of white men. Furthermore, he evokes the peculiar situation regional filmmakers, especially in Algeria and Lebanon, are now in regarding the women's place in their art. France has for the past decade, in particular, but not only, been offering funding for regional film production with the condition scripts place women in the core of their stories. The consequence of this phenomenon has therefore been an exponential increase in the MENA filmography surrounding women and their place in society. Nevertheless, these productions help reinforce a stereotypical image of the middle eastern women as oppressed, living in an all too conservative environment that awaits to break through only to live a “westernized” life experience. What could be seen in the first instance as a means to advocate for a change in the cinematographic horizon regarding women is transformed into a framework that reproduces a single, monolithic vision of the matter.

                         It was interesting to explore the notion of ‘self-perception’ of MENA women. Most of our interviewees conceded the inherent challenges in cementing an identity as an person MENA origin living abroad (with massive cultural differences), and the challenges media presents through misrepresentations. Professor Oualdi remarked how these women although are aware of the racism, sexism and misrepresentations that prevail, they are unapologetic about their identity. The notions of victimhood covered in media, doesn’t seep beneath their skin, they are able to boldly craft identities and talk about their personal lives in social media. By creating an expanse landscape of expression, and though personal feeds, media is able to humanise MENA women against these archetypes that is cultivated by media. 
 <br>
While misrepresentation of MENA women - as analysed above - lies predominantly in ‘Colonial & Oriental’ narratives and notions of victimhood, this phenomenon has shifted with the rise of social media. 8/9 interviewees (except Othmane) agree that social media enables MENA women to re-write narratives surrounding them, and marks a very promising change.  
<br> 
Firstly, social media is interactive and forges a two-way interaction between its publishers and audience. This facilitates people, especially MENA women to directly respond to false stereotypes and cultivates a culture in which women empower one another to speak against misrepresentation - a key aspect that traditional media lacks in. Not surprisingly social media such as instagram, also serves as a breeding ground for activism from MENA women to break stereotypes and misconceptions. Accounts such as ‘@pas.tabeurette’ that calls out misrepresentations in the media. (More examples can be found on our instagram page.) Our social media account is a very testament to this process. In one of our posts (regarding racist Chants), a lot of our followers responded and facilitated a discussion. As we posted these responses with individuals taking both sides, we had ‘claps’, ‘likes’ as well as further responses. 
<br> 
Secondly, social media creates outreach. When asked about the role of social media in empowering women, one of our interviewees responded with ‘[A]ll the girls have to learn that their voices matter’ She elaborated by saying that social media allowed the women of the region to recognize the importance of their individual input, as they started seeing the collective action of other women deriving change on the ground. 
<br> 
On the other hand, Othmane puts forth a very convincing argument against: “People follow and read up on what they want to follow”. He asserts that media creates these ‘echo chambers’  and isolates groups of people within the narratives that they familiarised themselves with. When you share and like certain types of posts, media algorithms pick up on it and feeds the content that you like. He asserts that social media does not necessarily have the capacity to change your views or enlighten you about what people on the other side of the spectrum are experiencing. While there is validity to this argument, it must be acknowledged that when movements such as ‘MeToo’ in MENA region  (Algeria and Tunisia as mentioned by our interviewees)  takes centre stage in social media, it is difficult to ignore and stay in one’s echo chamber. Besides, this same algorithm is what empowers MENA women. Meriem talks about feeling insecure when she spoke about Sexism in Tunisia in a French media, during a Feminist march when she was young. She proceeds to say how she doesn’t feel that insecure now. While there challenges and risks in using social media to break stereotypes, when these women realise that they are not alone in the struggle, and discover many accounts that speak up on misrepresentation and empower, it snowballs into massive Hashtag movements and forges discussions and debates. Ultimately, social media does empower MENA women and create a promising capacity for positive change for MENA women.
